I had a thought about what are the qualities that make me well-suited to be a developer in a start up. 

It seems like I favour going deep very quickly, and taking from two recent interviews and putting that experience next to my experiences working in small teams thus far:

I think I am a "depth first search" kind of developer, as opposed to the "breadth first search". Probably 80-20. There are so many mistakes that I make, many tasks I delegate to future me, even things I have said I will do and the time comes and then goes

Does being able to dive deep benefit in a generally autonomous developer environment? Of course being deep-focused has its caveats, so what about me?

Some negative consequences are working in an unsustainable manner, building up "focus" debt too large for future me to pay off. There can be massive upsides to it too, like pushing the only highest of priorities to meet deadlines. I'm not totally convinced of the upside for me though.

What kind of a developer has dominant "breadth first search" qualities? And who do I know who is so?

I can't think of anyone.
