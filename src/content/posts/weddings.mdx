Is love, a series of choices? Made in the presence of consideration, admiration and affection. \


Matters of the heart are almost dreadful but very close to my core being. Haha, I think Iâ€™m seldom this, but it happens. This evening I witnessed a happy marriage of my course mate. Once we used to share a room, three of us, sleeping on airbeds and mattresses from the street. Only one of us had their long distance relationship work, while Iâ€™m sure there were lessons learnt, I really canâ€™t help but reflect on the tough lows they went through and still made it. Love to see you make it  ðŸ‘Š 

It wouldnâ€™t have mattered that we were all battling the stress, we would be blind to ignore how blessed to be there learning and experiencing that life. It was hard to see then, but today I can say I recognise the effort required to make things work. At least I hope I do.

Iâ€™m in the early stages of a book , How to not die alone, written by an ex-hinge director. He says, there are three types of lovers. With his quick quiz, I fall into the third camp. Will update here, soon. 

\
Well, I wish you the best! Thanks for the thoughtful gifts, though the best one may just be this opportunity to reflect- after witnessing your wedding today! \


And I wish for all the happiness, and courage, to keep choosing right, in the tides today and tomorrow.
