description: Long day of figuring out Astro quirks

I had an idea about Unlikely app, showing interesting projects statistically unlikely to succeed but somehow made it big. It shows why it is statistically improbable to succeed, calculations and reasons behind it. Bonus: assumptions that must have broken since there was some success.

\
in other news, Iâ€™ve been trying to implement nanostore in Astro and it seems really tough to have it play nice. There must be a more elegant way to make certain things work, like script tags in Astro frontmatter with event listeners and nanostores or something.

\
So much debugging.

\
I have to get up early tmr. Today I met a few problems, but mostly about composition of Islands and React Islands in Astro. Interesting but long day. Bit mind boggling too.

\
Looked into some places to intern at. I should get back to James tmr too!
