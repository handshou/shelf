A big point of organising is to have the benefits of clarity. 

Organising information can bring clarity in a few ways. 

One. Let things grow neatly to allow the information to tell a story. The tidy spaces held neatly by structures can give you new dimensions of insight. How else can we see on roads if not for well lined pavements and clean road intersections? The overhead signs and marks on the ground. The clarity of the road lets us focus on the flow of traffic, and with that an appreciation of how cars orchestrate around each other. Tarmac, asphalt, concrete is the built structure - traffic flow is the abstraction on top.

This form of clarity is important and strategic because it informs what is ahead.

This week I've been writing tests, putting effort into refactoring components and layouts, weeding old code and making use of typing. I'm not sure if there are immediate benefits outside the time required to build these layers. But I feel satisfied with these early efforts as the code base grows a little more complex. Making one comparison to Erika's blog [source code](https://github.com/Princesseuh/erika.florist), I feel like this one's taking a very different direction. Interesting to see api written in rust, an absence of tests, and also a pull request to a v2 layout refresh! Her folder structure is something I'm paying close attention to. What I did not expect to be changing my mind about is how she has set some clear goals on web performance, I think I will set one or two goals to guide what I think this project will become.

On a separate tangent, I've been thinking of marriage. Not that it's on the periphery but in soon to come weddings in this end of year season, I see more friends committing and going deeper into a new phase. What are relationships, outside stages of personal development, and how are we doing really? Are we looking after our families, our friendships, our deeper commitments, our networks, our work? Though each person has their own journey, the life phases we experience are encapsulated in similar environments, similar cultures and similar challenges - so there is some shared experience. And I wonder if our shared experience is the last bastion of understanding between people, given that society largely feels like it is withdrawing and forming cocoons. Close to home, this effect could be partly due to urban planning in Singapore, shaping our environment to be pods within the city. I'm not sure. Is this assessment right?

It's almost 10pm. I'm happy to be focusing on eating much better, at better times, and hopefully it will translate to a month of resting better. Then I can address my recent fitness plateau with a strong focus on recovery :)

Good night!
